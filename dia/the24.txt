Theorem 2-4 The Linear Diophantine Equation states:

For Given Integers, a, b, and c:

    ax + by = c

has a solution if, and only if, gcd(a, b)|c.

Furthermore, if (x[0], y[0]) is a solution of this equation, then the set of solutions of this equation consists of all Integer pairs, (x[i], y[i]) where, for any Integer t:

    x[i] = x[0] + t(b/d)
    y[i] = y[0] - t(a/d)
