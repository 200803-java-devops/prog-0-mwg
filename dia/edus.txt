Theorem 1-1 is a simple theorem which observes the following:

For a given Natural Number, n, adding all consecutive Integers starting from 1, or technically you can say "starting from 0" and it would be the same, up to and including n is equal to:

    (n x (n + 1)) / 2

Theorem 1-2 states:

For any real number, x, where x != 1, and a given Natural Number, n, then:

    (x ^ 0) + (x ^ 1) + (x ^ 2) + ... + (x ^ (n - 1)) = ((x ^ n) - 1) / (x - 1)

Theorem 1-3 kinda looks like a first draft of The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic with hints of Euclid's Division Lemma sprinkled about:

For a given Natural Numbers, k and n, there exists:

    n = a[0]k^(s) + a[1]k^(s - 1) + ... + a[s]k^(0)

where a[0] != 0 and 0 <= a[i] < k. Also, this represenataion of n is unique in relation to k. This is referred to as "The representation of n to base k".

Theorem 2-1 Euclid's Division Lemma states:

For a given Natural Number, k and Integer, j, there exists a pair of Integers, q and r, such that:

    j = qk + r

 Also, 0 <= r < k and the pair (q, r) is unique.

Before getting to the theorem part, I'll explain what a Greatest Common Divisor is:

For given Integers, a and b, where a and b are not both 0, an Integer, d, is called the Greatest Common Divisor, or gcd, of a and b if:

    i. d > 0
    ii. d is a Common Divisor of a and b
    iii. all other Integers that are divisors of a and b are also divisors of d

Theorem 2-2 states:

For given Integers, a and b, where a and b are not both 0, then gcd(a, b) exists and is unique.

Theorem 2-4 The Linear Diophantine Equation states:

For Given Integers, a, b, and c:

    ax + by = c

has a solution if, and only if, for when gcd(a, b) = d, d|c.

Furthermore, if (x[0], y[0]) is a solution of this equation, then the set of solutions of this equation consists of all Integer pairs, (x[i], y[i]) where, for any Integer, t:

    x[i] = x[0] + t(b/d)
    y[i] = y[0] + t(a/d)
