Theorem 1-1 is a simple theorem which observes the following:

For a given Natural Number, n, adding all consecutive Integers starting from 1, or technically you can say "starting from 0" and it would be the same, up to and including n is equal to:

    (n x (n + 1)) / 2

Theorem 1-2 states:

For any real number, x, where x != 1, and a given Natural Number, n, then:

    (x ^ 0) + (x ^ 1) + (x ^ 2) + ... + (x ^ (n - 1)) = ((x ^ n) - 1) / (x - 1)
